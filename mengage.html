                        Looking for a job comes with its fair share of problems, but when you’re a graduate student, balancing studies and finding
                        time to search for employment opportunities is strenuous. The problem is exacerbated by factors like
                        information overload, not feeling confident about your portfolio, resume and other application materials
                        especially because of highly diverse backgrounds of applicants. Even though ninety-eight percent
                        of all UMSI students find jobs or internship in their field of choice, almost all students find the
                        process very stressful. My goal for this project was to understand what makes the current process
                        frustrating for students and try to improve the experience of finding employment opportunities and
                        make it less taxing.

                            <br> I started my design process by interviewing staff at the Career Development Office (CDO) at
                            the University of Michigan as they are experts with a lot of experience, to discover the pain
                            points in the process of finding an internship. I conducted three such interviews with the CDO
                            director, CDO assistant director and the CDO Employer Relations Coordinator which led to deeper
                            understanding of the problem. All three employees expressed their concern for the mental wellbeing
                            of students. Other factors that came up across all interviews were:

                            <br> To validate my findings from the SME interviews, I employed a participatory research approach
                            and tried to understand the students’ perspective. Over 20 first-year MSI students participated
                            in my participatory design approach. I handed out small index cards to my participants after
                            giving them a small description of the problem statement. The participants then wrote about the
                            concerns they had with respect to the problem on one side of the index card and on the other
                            side wrote what solutions they thought would work for them.

                            <br> I found this approach very helpful as this was a quick way to reach out to a large number of
                            students. At the end of this phase, I was able to identify the problems that current students
                            had and compare them to the problems that the subject matter experts had identified. The key
                            issues that came up during my interaction with current MSI students is summarized in the infographic
                            below.

                            Issues of information overload came up in interviews with both the stakeholders and additionally, students expressed that
                            they didn’t know if they were a good fit for a job. An interesting insight that can be drawn
                            out of this data chart shown above is that students didn’t express any concern for their well-being.
                            <br>
                            <br> The most demotivating factor according to the participants was “Getting no replies from recruiter”.
                            This refers to the fact that companies don’t send out a reply after the job application has been
                            submitted, and is a standard HR policy. Therefore, nothing can be done about this for the scope
                            of my project.

                            <br> After getting a feel of the problem, I used an ideation matrix to generate ideas and compare
                            potential solutions. To do so, I listed out the problems along one axis and potential solutions
                            across another. For every solution in the matrix, I checked off the problems it solved and at
                            the end, I had a matrix which looked like the one shown below.
                            <br>

                            <br> I found this method very useful to compare solutions objectively and get ideas for sketching
                            solutions. I chose the top eight ideas from this matrix and sketched them out. Sketching these
                            ideas led me to better understand what use cases these solutions had and when they can be used.

                            <br> To augment these sketches and to get feedback on my ideas, I developed storyboards, so that
                            people who didn’t have context could understand what these solutions meant and given them example
                            of certain scenarios when these solutions can actually be used. The storyboards are shown below:

                            <br> After finishing my sketches and storyboards, I went out and talked to my users again and asked
                            them what they thought about my potential solutions. Based on the feedback I gathered, I decided
                            to solve the problem of information overload and lack of a centralized community for resources
                            related to employment by creating an online discussion forum. My solution leverages the already
                            existing, strong UMSI (University of Michigan, School of Information) community and is a online
                            forum which facilitates discussion and provides various step by step guides to tackle the problem
                            of information overload head-on.The online community will engage the alumni, current MSI students
                            and the CDO staff in an effort to make life a little less stressful for the current MSI students
                            by leveraging the strong knowledge-base of alumni and CDO staff.

                            The community also serves as an easy and non demanding medium for the alumni to give back to the community, as current initiatives
                            include spending considerable amount of time, e.g. peer coaching over video call.

                            <br> The solution I was aiming for was an online community only for the UMSI community, therefore,
                            I compared products that were available to current students. There were several options, iTrack
                            for job postings, Canvas for discussion, the open MCommunity email discussion channel, however,
                            they all fell short of the addressing the needs of the users. iTrack has no option to facilitate
                            discussion or ask questions, I also found out that it has job postings from over a year ago which
                            means that it’s not updated to remove previous postings which leads to lack of reliability at
                            times. Canvas allows for students to ask questions and facilitates discussion but there is no
                            option to filter posts or see posts according to a ranking scheme.

                            <br>
                            <br> Another direct competitor to my application was reddit which offers a lot of my intended features
                            however, it doesn’t have any way to control access only to UM community, and since, it is a feed
                            based system, finding guides (content that is static) would be difficult on it. Through this
                            analysis I decided that such content is best kept separate from the dynamic feed so that users
                            can easily access it. Competitive analysis helped me understand what features should be implemented
                            in the application and more importantly how to implement them as I learned about what works and
                            what does not across a spectrum of already existing solutions.

                            referred back to them to before implementing any new features. I found personas to be a very
                            useful artifact as I used them to prioritize implementing features for users. E.g. I chose to
                            implement FEED first over the podcast feature because the feed served all four personas while
                            the podcast only served two personas, only the first year students and second year students.

                            with each other and critique portfolios/resumes. All posts on the FEED are tagged so that users
                            can filter posts according to their interests. These tags were created after understanding what

                            This section of the application tries to solve the issue of information overload by creating step-by-step guide. The career
                            development office has a course called “Internship studio” in the winter term, which will help
                            the students in an finding internship. Using this course as a starting point, the office with
                            the help of students taking the class, can generate different condensed guides which are step
                            by step instructions for different facets related to internship search. Some of these guides
                            can be:

                            <strong>Access Control:</strong>
                            The online community would be restricted to only UMSI members so that members from outside the community don’t abuse and
                            spam the system. Additionally, restricting the community to UMSI would mean that the posts will
                            be more relevant to the user base. The application doesn’t require the users to sign in to start
                            using the application but only to sign in when the user chooses to interact: create new post,
                            comment, upvote, downvote, etc. I did this to the number of steps required for a user to engage
                            with the community.

                            <br> After deciding on the features, I mapped out the user journey as follow :

                            <br>

                            With an idea of functionality and information flow, I created paper prototypes for the application. Find the video documenting
                            these interactions below:

                            <br> I used the low fidelity prototypes to test out different features and see how they were received
                            by the users. Low fidelity prototypes served as a useful tool to present ideas in a tangible
                            manner. I handed out my prototypes to different users and asked them to trying accomplishing
                            different tasks. I found this particularly useful as I could see where users were having difficulties
                            and which labels were difficult to understand for the users. Initially I had planned to keep
                            a single feed for all content in my application but based on feedback I received, I decided to
                            change it to separate feeds as people thought that it was not clear what GUIDEs meant. I also
                            tested out initially by placing buttons for sorting the feeds but based on feedback I got, people
                            thought it would be easier if tabs were used to navigate between the fields. I used the feedback
                            from the multiple users during the low-fidelity prototyping to make appropriate changes to my
                            final prototypes.

                        feedback and usability tests. I found that interviewing subject matter experts was very useful.
                        The iterative approach that I followed allowed me to make better informed design decisions and
                        a product which users were comfortable using.

                        <blockquote>
                            Throughout the process my main intention was keep my user in mind and design product which they would find useful. I placed
                            a lot of emphasis on the initial research before doing any other work because I wanted to
                            thoroughly understand my users.
                        </blockquote>

                        I hope the platform that I envision to create will lead to stronger bonds in the UMSI community and bolster the connections
                        in this community!
